# collatz-conjecture
This is a tiny program that simulates the simplest math problem no one can solve, aka. collatz conjecture. Enter any integer greater than 1 and let the simulation run.

***

## What is the collatz conjecture?

1. Start with any integer n > 0. 
2. If even, divite n by two.
3. If odd, multiply n by three and then add one.
4. Repeat this process.

The interesting thing is that n will always end in the 4, 2, 1 cycle.
